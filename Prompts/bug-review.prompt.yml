  ### AI Assessment: Ready for Review | Missing Details | Unsure

  Provide a concise assessment for maintainers:
  - Determine if the report is ready for engineering review, missing critical info, or unsure.
  - If missing, list exactly which items are absent or unclear: reproduction steps, expected vs actual, logs/errors, MZmine version/build, Java version, OS.
  - If ready, briefly summarize the suspected area (if any) and any quick triage checks.
  - Offer next steps: request missing artifacts or suggest a minimal reproduction, log capture instructions, or pointers to related modules.

  Keep it brief and actionable. Do not include speculation beyond the issue content.
