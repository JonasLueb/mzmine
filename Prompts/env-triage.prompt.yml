      ### AI Assessment: Environment Suspect | Not Environment | Unsure

      Provide 4-6 targeted checks, then next steps:
      - Java version compatibility (e.g., Java 17). Include `java -version`.
      - JVM memory flags (-Xmx) vs dataset size; suggest increasing heap if needed.
      - OS specifics (Windows path length, macOS Gatekeeper, Linux packages).
      - Native dependencies if relevant; confirm none are missing.
      - Locale/decimal separator issues; confirm locale settings.
      - Permissions and long/special-character paths.
