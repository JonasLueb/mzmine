  Start your reply with exactly one of the following H3 headings on the first line:
  - "### AI Assessment: Usage/Support"
  - "### AI Assessment: Likely Bug"
  - "### AI Assessment: Unsure"

  Then provide a concise, actionable triage:
  - If Usage/Support: advise moving to Discussions with concrete pointers (features/modules, config steps) and what to include.
  - If Likely Bug: list required artifacts (minimal repro steps, expected vs actual, logs, MZmine version/build, Java version, OS, data specifics if relevant) and immediate next steps.
  - If Unsure: list what would disambiguate.

  Keep it brief and avoid generic text.
