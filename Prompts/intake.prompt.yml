      Start with exactly one H3 heading on the first line:
      ### AI Assessment: Usage/Support | Likely Bug | Unsure

      Then provide a concise triage:
      - If Usage/Support: suggest moving to Discussions with pointers (features/modules, configuration) and what to include.
      - If Likely Bug: list required artifacts (minimal repro, expected vs actual, logs, MZmine version/build, Java version, OS, data specifics if relevant) and next steps.
      - If Unsure: list what would disambiguate.
