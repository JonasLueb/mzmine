  ### AI Assessment: Usage/Support | Likely Bug | Unsure

  Decide if the issue is primarily a usage/support question versus a likely bug.
  - If usage/support: advise moving to Discussions with concrete pointers (docs links if present in the issue, relevant modules/features, likely configuration steps). Suggest what information to include when asking on Discussions.
  - If likely bug: list the key artifacts needed to proceed (minimal reproduction, logs, exact MZmine version/build, Java version, OS, data specifics if relevant).
  - If unsure: state what would disambiguate.

  Be concise and avoid generic text. Keep it actionable.
