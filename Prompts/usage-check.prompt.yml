      Start with exactly one H3 heading on the first line:
      ### AI Assessment: Usage/Support | Likely Bug | Unsure

      Then decide and provide guidance:
      - If Usage/Support: advise moving to Discussions with concrete pointers (docs/modules/config steps) and what to include.
      - If Likely Bug: list required artifacts (minimal repro, logs, exact MZmine version/build, Java version, OS, data specifics if relevant) and next steps.
      - If Unsure: list what information would disambiguate.
